# Threat Modeling Repo
Welcome to the Threat Modeling Repository, a curated collection of threat models across various technologies to assist security professionals, developers, and researchers in identifying and addressing potential security threats. This repository provides easy-to-use, markdown-based threat models that can be quickly adapted to your specific needs specially in the cases of asset based threat modeling.

## üöÄ What is Threat Modeling?
Threat modeling is a systematic approach to identifying, analyzing, and mitigating potential security risks in a system. By understanding where your system might be vulnerable, you can develop strategies to reduce the risk of attacks before they happen. Each threat model in this repository is designed to guide you through different technologies and applicable threats.

## üìÑ What Does This Repository Include?
This repository will include threat models from various technology areas, such as:

-Embedded Systems <br>
-API Gateways <i>(coming soon)</i><br>
-Large Language Models (LLMs) <i>(coming soon)</i><br>
-Cloud Infrastructure <i>(coming soon)</i><br>
-Web Applications <i>(coming soon)</i><br>
-Identity and Access Management Systems <i>(coming soon)</i><br>

Each threat model is structured in a markdown file for easy readability and modification, ensuring you can integrate these models into your own threat analysis process or adapt them as needed for specific projects.

## üõ†Ô∏è How to Use
-Navigate to the relevant technology file in the repository. <br>
-Open the markdown file of the threat model you‚Äôre interested in. Each file follows a structured format, typically including:<br>
-Overview: A brief introduction to the system or technology area.<br>
-Assets: Key assets or components that need protection.<br>
-Threats: Common threats that the system may face.<br>
-Mitigations: Strategies and actions to mitigate identified threats.<br>

## üéØ Who Is This For?
This repository is designed for:<br>

-Security Engineers and Cybersecurity Professionals looking for structured threat models for various technologies.<br>
-Developers wanting to integrate security considerations early in the development lifecycle.<br>
-Researchers exploring potential vulnerabilities and mitigation strategies in different technological domains.<br>
-Students and educators using threat modeling as a tool for learning and teaching cybersecurity best practices.<br>
